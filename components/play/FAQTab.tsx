        During the beta testing phase follow Sendou's Twitter for updates. You
        can choose when to play - there is no commitment. <br />
        <br />
        The plan after the beta testing phase is to have 5 event dates a week
        when you can play: Monday and Wednesday Americas friendly times (8PM
        ET). Tuesday and Thursday Europe friendly times (8PM CET). Sunday for a
        time that is aimed for both regions (9PM CET).

    q: "How many matches do we play when we register for an event?",
    a: (
      <>
        If there is an even number of teams everyone plays 2 matches. If there
        is an uneven number of teams then two teams play 1 match each and the
        rest play 2 matches.
      </>

    q:
      "Can I switch who I play with between the event dates? Can I sign up without a team?",
    a: (
      <>
        You can play with a different set of people each time you play the
        ladder if you want. However you need to find people to play with before
        signing up (so it doesn't work like solo queue in that sense).

  {
    q: "What this the format of the matches?",

        Best of 9. Even numbered weeks SZ/TC/RM/CB but Splat Zones is the every
        other mode. Uneven numbered weeks SZ only.

    q: "How are the teams matched?",
    a: (
      <>
        The algorithm goes through every possible way to pair the teams that are
        signed up. It chooses the match-ups based on which two ways without
        repeat matches produce the best quality of matches. Quality of match is
        determined by the theoretical likelihood of a draw as provided by the
        ranking system we use.

  {
    q: "Why are players ranked and not teams? What does this mean in practice?",
    a: (
      <>
        In Splatoon teams are pretty volatile. It's common for people to play
        with a lot of different people. Even in one team there is typically a
        big difference in level depending on who from the roster is playing.
        Ranking players lets us have more accurate rankings in these conditions.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you always play with the same people the ranking system won't be able
        to make a difference between your scores. The difference only comes if
        you play with different people also.

    q: "DC rules?",
    a: (
      <>
        One DC replay per team per set is allowed. If DC happens before the game
        started (counted from players being able to move) room should be remade
        without DC replays being used. DC replay is only granted if it was less
        than 2 minutes 30 seconds into the match AND the team's score without DC
        didn't pass the 50 point mark AND the team with the DC stopped playing
        without delay.
        <br />
        <br /> If host DC's during game the hosting team has to use their DC
        replay if they have any left otherwise they lose the map.

    q: "Who hosts?",
    a: (

        If you can't agree which team should host then the team who is on the
        left side chooses a player in their team to host the room.

  {
    q: "How do I report the score?",
    a: (
      <>
        You report the score by DM'ing the bot Lanista#5266. The bot can be
        found on our{" "}
        <MyLink isExternal href="https://discord.gg/sendou">
          Discord
        </MyLink>
        . If you have not registed your Nintendo account with Lanista you have
        to use the <code>!register</code> command before. After that reporting
        the score is done with the <code>!sendoureport</code> command. <br />
        <br />
        If you have problems please contact Lean#3146 on Discord.
